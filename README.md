# Project: Network Port Scanner

## Introduction-
A port scanner is a crucial tool for network security professionals and enthusiasts. It allows us to discover open, closed, or filtered ports on a target system. In this project, Iâ€™ll create a basic port scanner using Python.

## Features
- Single Host Scanning: Scan a single IP address for open ports within a specified range.
- Multi-Host Scanning: Scan multiple IP addresses sequentially for open ports.
- Fast and Efficient: Uses threading to speed up the scanning process.
- Real-Time Results: Displays open ports in real-time during the scan.
- Lightweight and Fast: Designed for simplicity and performance.
- Error Handling: Handles unreachable hosts and invalid input gracefully.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
- socket: for network communication
- sys: For handling command-line arguments.
- datetime: To calculate scan duration.

## Output:

This is a Vulnerable machine IP called "metasploitable 2.0". Here's what get back from our scanning. This is very nice tool and very fast.
